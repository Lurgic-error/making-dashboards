Calvin Harris - Under Control (feat. Hurts)

[Verse 1]
I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you'll never know
When the daylight comes, you feel so cold, you know
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go

[Chorus]
Waiting for the fire to light
Feeling like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control
We're under control

[Verse 2]
I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you'll never know
When the daylight comes, you feel so cold, you know
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go

[Chorus]
Waiting for the fire to light
Feeling like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control
Waiting for the fire to light
Feeling like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control
We're under control
